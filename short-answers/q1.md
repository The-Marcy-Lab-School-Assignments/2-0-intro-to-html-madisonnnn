# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
Semantic elements tell the browser and users information about the content of the tag. Non-semantic elements don't specify the content of the tag.

# Teacher Feedback

This is true! Also non-semantic tags will be used for grouping and semantic tags are better for accessibility!
